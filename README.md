This repository contains an example of how to integrate Power BI with GitHub data. The Power BI file (`.pbix`) included in this repository demonstrates how to visualize and analyze GitHub repository data.

## Contents

- `example.pbix`: The Power BI file containing the data model and visualizations.
- `README.md`: This file, providing an overview of the repository.

## Getting Started

To get started with this Power BI example, follow these steps:

1. **Download Power BI Desktop**: If you don't already have Power BI Desktop installed, download and install it from the [official Power BI website](https://powerbi.microsoft.com/desktop/).

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/saif131/powerBi_github_example.git
    ```

3. **Open the Power BI File**: Open the `example.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.

4. **Connect to GitHub Data**: Update the data source settings to connect to your GitHub repository. You may need to provide your GitHub credentials or a personal access token.

5. **Refresh the Data**: Refresh the data in Power BI to load the latest data from your GitHub repository.

## Visualizations

The Power BI file includes the following visualizations:

- **Repository Activity**: A dashboard showing the number of commits, pull requests, and issues over time.
- **Top Contributors**: A chart displaying the top contributors to the repository.
- **Issue Breakdown**: A visualization of open and closed issues by label and milestone.

## Customization

You can customize the Power BI file to suit your needs by adding new visualizations, modifying existing ones, or changing the data model. Refer to the [Power BI documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/power-bi/) for more information on how to use Power BI.
